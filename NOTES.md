# Notes

What I find, measure and decide, by date. The plan is in `docs/plan.md`.

## Pinned versions

- Bend **2.0.35**, Lean 4.34.0 (installed by bend-ml's `scripts/setup.sh`), as in bend-ml v1.2.1.
- bend-ml packages from BendHub: `bend-ml-tensor-array@0.1.6.0`, `bend-ml-bpe-tokenizer@0.1.2.0`.
- Model: `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-135M` at revision `93efa2f097d58c2a74874c7e644dbc9b0cee75a2`.
- Python side: versions in `reference/requirements.txt`.

## 2026-10-09: start, and milestone 1 (prep)

### Decisions

- Its own repository (`nuxyel/llama.bend`), private until it works; the typed layers become the BendHub package
  `bend-ml-llama`. My 2026-10-05 notes put the demo inside bend-ml; a separate repo keeps bend-ml's checks
  fast and lets this one move on its own.
- Products with `Bands` + `Bands.matvec_l` (`bend-ml-tensor-array@0.1.6.0`), not `Mat.matmul_nt` as those
  notes said: since 0.1.6.0 one band costs about what `matmul_nt` costs, and more bands run in parallel.
- Oracle: `transformers` and `tokenizers` on the CPU.

### The model, checked against `config.json` at the pinned revision

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| architecture | `LlamaForCausalLM` |
| hidden_size | 576 |
| heads / key-value heads | 9 / 3: head size 64, 3 query heads per key-value head, key/value width 192 |
| layers | 30 |
| intermediate_size | 1536 (SwiGLU, `silu`) |
| rms_norm_eps | 1e-5; no bias anywhere |
| rope_theta | 100000, `rope_interleaved = false` (rotate-half) |
| vocab_size | 49152, tied embedding (LM head = embedding) |
| dtype | bfloat16, `model.safetensors` 269,060,552 bytes |

272 tensors, **134,515,008 numbers** (embedding 28,311,552; 3,540,096 per layer; final norm 576).

### Tokenizer facts

- Pre-tokenizer: `Sequence[Digits(individual_digits = true), ByteLevel(use_regex = true)]`. `Digits` uses
  Rust's `char::is_numeric` (`huggingface/tokenizers`, `tk-encode/src/pre_tokenizers/digits.rs`), that is
  Unicode `\p{N}`, which is already class 1 of bend-ml's `demos/gpt2/unicode.bend` table. No new class needed.
- 17 special tokens (ids 0-16), then the byte tokens, then one id per merge.
- **21 bytes have no token**: 0xC0, 0xC1, 0xF5-0xFF (never in valid UTF-8) and the control bytes 4, 6, 19, 20,
  22, 29. So the byte tokens are ids 17-251 (235 of them), and 17 + 235 + 48,900 merges = 49,152. Every merge k
  gives id **252 + k** (all 48,900), no merge rebuilds an earlier token and none is missing from the vocabulary.
- With no `unk_token` and no `byte_fallback`, `tokenizers` drops a byte that has no token, before the merges:
  "a\x04b" gives [a, b]. `reference/prep.py` does the same; the Bend tokenizer will have to as well.
- A special token written as text (`<|endoftext|>`) is matched by `tokenizers` before pre-tokenization; out of
  scope for the demo (prompts are plain text).

### Milestone 1 result

`make prep && make check` (`reference/prep.py`):

- `data/w/<name>.bin`, one little-endian F32 file per tensor, row = output: all 272 equal to the bf16 bits
  shifted left by 16, bit for bit.
- `data/merges_num.txt` (48,900 rules in bend-ml's numbering) and `data/ids.txt` (the model id of each symbol,
  -1 for the 21 bytes): applying the rules in order to the pieces of my pre-tokenizer (each `\p{N}` character
  alone, then the GPT-2 regex) gives the same pieces and the same ids as `tokenizers` on 10 texts: ASCII,
  Portuguese, prices, dates and long numbers, Arabic and Devanagari digits, fractions, Roman numerals,
  superscripts, circled and full-width digits, emoji, CJK, Korean, control bytes, Python code.
